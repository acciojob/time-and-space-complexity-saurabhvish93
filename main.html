   <h1>Time, Space Complexity</h1>
	<p><b>Time Complexity: </b>The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.
	An effecient algorithm is that which takes less time an space while solving any problem.</p>
	<p>Spance complexity is a concept used for analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm.It is calculated on the basis of input size the space grows.O(n) spance complexity is considered a good one.
	</p>
	<p>Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b><u>space complexity</u></b> of the algorithm.</p>
